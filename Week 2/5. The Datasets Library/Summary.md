## Summary

This chapter discussed how to use the HuggingFace datasets and how to access other datasets online or through GitHub. One of the problems I encountered was that I couldn't get my GitHub token to work, so I couldn't pull the GitHub dataset in one of the sections. They also did not include everything that needed to be downloaded which was a minor roadbump. One of the law datasets did not work either since the link to the dataset didn't exist anymore.
