## Summary

Section 11 focuses on Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) of pretrained LMs using labeled instruction-response data, while using LoRA (Low-Rank Adapters) to make fine-tuning efficient and parameter-sparse. In practice you prepare a cleaned, tokenized dataset of prompts and targets, freeze most of the base model weights, and inject small low-rank adapter matrices into attention / feed-forward layers; only those adapter parameters are trained, which dramatically reduces GPU memory and storage needs. This workflow preserves the base model’s general knowledge, speeds up training, and makes sharing updates cheaper (you can share just the LoRA weights), but it still requires careful hyperparameter tuning, proper batching/prompt formatting, and evaluation on held-out instruction examples to avoid overfitting. Monitoring training/validation loss and task metrics shows how well SFT+LoRA is improving task performance; if validation loss plateaus or diverges from training loss you should reduce learning rate, add regularization, or check data quality. Overall, SFT+LoRA is a practical compromise for adapting large models to supervised tasks while keeping compute and storage costs manageable.
