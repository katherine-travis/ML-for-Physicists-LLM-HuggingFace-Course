## Summary

Section 9 teaches you how to turn machine learning models into interactive demos using Gradio, and how to share those demos with others or host them on Hugging Face Spaces. You learn that Gradio is model-agnostic, so it works with any ML framework, not just PyTorch, and can be launched from standard Python scripts, Jupyter notebooks, or Google Colab.
The chapter focuses on the core Interface class, where you define your model function and connect it to pre-built UI components like textboxes, image uploaders, audio inputs, and more. You also learn how to support multiple inputs/outputs and how to add state, which lets your demo remember conversation history or intermediate values across interactions. The course then introduces Blocks, a more flexible system for building multi-step, multi-component apps with tabs, event triggers, conditional logic, and reusable components. Finally, you learn how to share demos using share=True or deploy them publicly through Hugging Face Spaces.
